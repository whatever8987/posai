## How to Use

### Automatic Training (Recommended)

When a new salon signs up, the AI is automatically trained:

```bash
# Via API
POST /api/v1/training/auto-train
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

# Returns:
{
  "success": true,
  "ddl_trained": true,
  "questions_trained": 30,
  "documentation_added": 8,
  "errors": []
}
```

### Check Training Status

```bash
GET /api/v1/training/status
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

# Returns:
{
  "is_trained": true,
  "tenant_id": "uuid"
}
```

### Manual Training

For custom training data:

```bash
POST /api/v1/training/train-custom
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "What's our busiest day of the week?",
  "sql": "SELECT TO_CHAR(booking_date, 'Day') as day, COUNT(*) FROM bookings GROUP BY TO_CHAR(booking_date, 'Day') ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1"
}
```

### Retrain (Add More Examples)

To improve accuracy or add new examples:

```bash
POST /api/v1/training/retrain
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

# This adds new training data without replacing existing data
```

## Training Scripts

### For Developers

#### Command-Line Training

```bash
cd backend
python training/train_tenant.py <tenant_uuid>
```

#### In Code

```python
from app.services.vanna_service import VannaService

# Initialize service
vanna = VannaService(tenant_id="your-tenant-id")

# Auto-train with all examples
results = await vanna.auto_train_tenant_schema()

# Check if trained
if vanna.is_trained():
    print("‚úì AI is trained and ready")
```

#### View Training Summary

```bash
cd backend/training
python standard_schema_training.py

# Output:
# ============================================================

## Training Data Quality

### Coverage Breakdown

| Category | Examples | Coverage |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Customer Analytics | 4 | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Booking Management | 5 | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Service Analytics | 4 | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Technician Performance | 4 | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Total:** 30 examples + 8 business terms = **38 training items**

### Query Complexity Levels

- **Simple (40%)**: Single table, basic filters
- **Medium (35%)**: 2-3 table joins, aggregations
- **Complex (25%)**: Multi-table joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions

## Best Practices

### When to Auto-Train

‚úÖ **Do auto-train:**
- New salon signup
- After POS integration sync
- Clean database state

‚ùå **Don't auto-train:**
- If already trained (will be skipped)
- During active queries (no conflicts, but unnecessary)

### When to Retrain

Use retrain when:
1. **Schema Changes**: Added new tables or columns
2. **New Business Logic**: Different calculation methods
3. **Improved Examples**: Better SQL patterns discovered
4. **Accuracy Issues**: AI generating incorrect SQL

### When to Use Custom Training

Add custom training for:
- **Salon-Specific Terms**: Custom service names, categories
- **Unique Workflows**: Special booking processes
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual queries AI struggles with
- **Domain Knowledge**: Industry-specific calculations

## Examples of AI Improvement

### Before Enhancement
**Question:** "Who are our VIP customers?"  
**AI Response:** ‚ùå Error - doesn't understand "VIP"

### After Enhancement
**Question:** "Who are our top 10 customers by total spending?"  
**AI Response:** ‚úÖ Correct SQL with proper joins and aggregation

---

### Before Enhancement
**Question:** "Which customers might churn?"  
**AI Response:** ‚ùå Error - doesn't understand "churn"

### After Enhancement  
**Question:** "Which customers haven't visited in the last 60 days?"  
**AI Response:** ‚úÖ Correct SQL identifying at-risk customers

---

### Before Enhancement
**Question:** "Show technician performance"  
**AI Response:** ‚ùå Basic count query

### After Enhancement
**Question:** "Show technician performance with commission and tips"  
**AI Response:** ‚úÖ Complex query with calculations, grouping, and formatting

## Monitoring Training Quality

### Check Training Success

```bash
# Via API
GET /api/v1/training/status

# Via logs
Check backend logs for:
"‚úì Trained 30 questions successfully"
"‚úì Added 8 documentation entries"
```

### Test AI Accuracy

```bash
# Ask test questions
POST /api/v1/query/
{
  "question": "Who are our top 5 customers?",
  "execute": false
}

# Verify SQL looks correct
# If incorrect, add more training examples
```

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding Correctly

1. **Check if trained:**
   ```bash
   GET /api/v1/training/status
   ```

2. **Retrain if needed:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/training/retrain
   ```

3. **Add custom examples:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/training/train-custom
   {
     "question": "specific question",
     "sql": "correct SQL"
   }
   ```

### Training Failed

Check error messages in response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": ["Error training question 5: ..."]
}
```

Common causes:
- Ollama not running
- ChromaDB path issues
- Invalid SQL syntax in training data

### Slow Training

Training 30+ examples takes time:
- Expected: 30-60 seconds
- If longer: Check Ollama performance
- Consider batch training during off-hours
