        Date Functions:

        String Functions:
        - ILIKE (case-insensitive LIKE)
        - || for concatenation (not CONCAT)
        - POSITION('substr' IN string) or STRPOS
        
        Aggregates:
        - PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY col) for median
        - STRING_AGG for string concatenation
